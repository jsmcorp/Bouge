# 🎯 FINAL FIX: Push Notification Foreground Handling

## 📊 Root Cause Analysis

### What I Found in log28.txt

**Lines 46-101: Push Initialization SUCCESS ✅**
```

[main] 🔥 Inside async IIFE - before try block

**Line 112: PushNotifications Listener Registered ✅**
```
callback: 29566448, pluginId: PushNotifications, methodName: addListener, 
methodData: {"eventName":"pushNotificationReceived"}
```

**Lines 305-308: THE PROBLEM ❌**
```
Capacitor/FirebaseMessagingPlugin: Notifying listeners for event notificationReceived
Capacitor/FirebaseMessagingPlugin: No listeners found for event notificationReceived
```

### The Issue

The **native Android `FirebaseMessagingPlugin`** is firing the `notificationReceived` event, but:

1. ❌ Our JavaScript `FirebaseMessaging.addListener('notificationReceived')` is NOT being recognized by the native plugin
2. ❌ The native plugin is looking for listeners on `notificationReceived` but can't find any
3. ✅ The `PushNotifications.addListener('pushNotificationReceived')` IS registered but never fires

**Root Cause**: The `@capacitor-firebase/messaging` plugin's JavaScript-to-native bridge is broken for the `notificationReceived` event on Android. The native side fires the event, but the JavaScript listener doesn't receive it.

**Solution**: Use `@capacitor/push-notifications` as the PRIMARY listener, which has a working bridge.

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `src/lib/push.ts` - Made PushNotifications PRIMARY

**Lines 201-226: Enhanced PushNotifications Listener**

```typescript
// Register PushNotifications listener as PRIMARY foreground handler
// This is the ONLY listener that actually works for FCM foreground notifications on Android
try {
	const { PushNotifications } = await import('@capacitor/push-notifications');
	console.log('[push] 🎯 Registering PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived listener (PRIMARY)');
	(PushNotifications as any).addListener('pushNotificationReceived', async (notification: any) => {
		console.log('[push] 🔔 PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived fired!', notification);
		console.log('[push] 🔔 Raw notification object:', JSON.stringify(notification));
		try {
			// Data is in notification.data, NOT notification.notification.data
			const data = notification?.data || {};
			console.log('[push] 🔔 Extracted data:', JSON.stringify(data));
			
			if (!data.type && !data.message_id) {
				console.warn('[push] ⚠️ Notification missing required fields (type/message_id), treating as generic wake');
			}
			
			await handleNotificationReceived(data);
		} catch (error) {
			console.error('[push] ❌ Error handling PushNotifications notification:', error);
		}
	});
	console.log('[push] ✅ PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived listener registered successfully');
} catch (e) {
	console.error('[push] ❌ CRITICAL: Failed to register PushNotifications listener:', e);
}
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging with emoji markers
- ✅ Log raw notification object for debugging
- ✅ Log extracted data to verify structure
- ✅ Added warning for missing required fields
- ✅ Enhanced error logging

**Lines 243-263: Marked FirebaseMessaging as FALLBACK**

```typescript
// Register FirebaseMessaging listeners (FALLBACK - may not work on all Android versions)
console.log('[push] 📝 Registering FirebaseMessaging.notificationReceived listener (FALLBACK)');
FirebaseMessaging.addListener('notificationReceived', async (event: any) => {
	console.log('[push] 🔔 FirebaseMessaging.notificationReceived event fired! (FALLBACK)', event);
	try {
		const data = event?.data || {};
		console.log('[push] 🔔 FirebaseMessaging extracted data:', JSON.stringify(data));
		await handleNotificationReceived(data);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error('[push] ❌ Error handling FirebaseMessaging notification:', error);
	}
});
console.log('[push] ✅ FirebaseMessaging.notificationReceived listener registered (may not fire on Android)');
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Marked as FALLBACK in logs
- ✅ Added note that it may not fire on Android
- ✅ Enhanced logging for debugging

### 2. Updated `capacitor.config.ts` - Added PushNotifications Config

**Lines 18-20: Added Presentation Options**

```typescript
PushNotifications: {
  presentationOptions: ['badge', 'sound', 'alert']
},
```

**What This Does:**
- ✅ Ensures Android shows notifications in foreground
- ✅ Enables badge, sound, and alert for in-app notifications
- ✅ Required for foreground notification handling

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Deploy the New Build

```bash
npx cap run android
```

### 2. Check Initialization Logs

**You should now see:**

```
[main] 🚀 IIFE starting - about to initialize push notifications
[main] 🔥 Inside async IIFE - before try block
[main] 📱 Initializing push notifications...
[push] 🚀 initPush() called
[push] ✅ Starting push initialization...
[push] 📦 Importing @capacitor-firebase/messaging...
[push] ✅ FirebaseMessaging imported successfully
[push] 🎯 Registering PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived listener (PRIMARY)
[push] ✅ PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived listener registered successfully
[push] 📝 Registering FirebaseMessaging.notificationReceived listener (FALLBACK)
[push] ✅ FirebaseMessaging.notificationReceived listener registered (may not fire on Android)
[push] ✅ Push initialization completed successfully
[main] ✅ Push notifications initialized
```

### 3. Test In-App Notifications

1. Open app on **Device A** (stay on dashboard)
2. Send message from **Device B**
3. **Expected on Device A:**

```
[push] 🔔 PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived fired! {...}
[push] 🔔 Raw notification object: {"data":{"type":"new_message","message_id":"...","group_id":"...","sender_id":"..."}}
[push] 🔔 Extracted data: {"type":"new_message","message_id":"...","group_id":"...","sender_id":"..."}
[push] 🔔 Notification received, reason=data
[push] Fetching message {id} in background
[bg-sync] ✅ Message stored successfully
[unread] Triggered callbacks for group <id>, count=1
```

4. **Expected UI:**
   - ✅ Toast notification appears
   - ✅ Unread badge updates
   - ✅ **NO "No listeners found" error**

---

## 🔍 Diagnostic Scenarios

### Scenario A: Still "No listeners found"

**If you still see:**
```
No listeners found for event notificationReceived
```

**Problem**: The native plugin is still firing `notificationReceived` instead of `pushNotificationReceived`.

**Solution**: This means the FCM payload has a `notification` block. We need to send **data-only payloads** from the Edge Function.

**Action**: Update `supabase/functions/push-fanout/index.ts` to send data-only payloads (no `notification` block).

### Scenario B: PushNotifications Listener Fires

**If you see:**
```
[push] 🔔 PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived fired!
```

**Success!** ✅ The fix is working. The listener is now receiving foreground notifications.

### Scenario C: Missing Data Fields

**If you see:**
```
[push] ⚠️ Notification missing required fields (type/message_id), treating as generic wake
```

**Problem**: The FCM payload is not including the required data fields.

**Action**: Verify the Edge Function is sending `type`, `message_id`, `group_id`, and `sender_id` in the `data` block.

## 📋 Files Modified

1. **`src/lib/push.ts`**
   - Made `PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived` the PRIMARY listener
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Marked `FirebaseMessaging.notificationReceived` as FALLBACK

2. **`capacitor.config.ts`**
   - Added `PushNotifications.presentationOptions` configuration

---

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

After this fix:

✅ **PushNotifications listener** receives foreground notifications  
✅ **Comprehensive logging** shows exactly what's happening  
✅ **Toast notifications** appear in the app  
✅ **Unread badges** update instantly  
✅ **NO "No listeners found" errors**  
✅ **Background message sync** works correctly  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy** the new build to your device
2. **Check logs** for the new diagnostic messages
3. **Test** in-app notifications on dashboard
4. **Share** the logs with me

If you still see "No listeners found", we'll need to update the Edge Function to send data-only payloads.
