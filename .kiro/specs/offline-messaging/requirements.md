# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to send messages even when offline or disconnected from the server. Messages sent while offline will be stored locally in an outbox and automatically synchronized with the server when connectivity is restored. The existing outbox functionality is already implemented but is currently blocked by UI restrictions that prevent message sending when disconnected.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to send messages even when I'm offline or disconnected, so that I can continue communicating without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is offline or disconnected THEN the message input field SHALL remain enabled and functional
2. WHEN the user is offline or disconnected THEN the send button SHALL remain enabled for text messages
3. WHEN the user sends a message while offline THEN the message SHALL appear in the chat with a "sent" status
4. WHEN the user sends a message while offline THEN the message SHALL be stored in the local outbox for later synchronization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a clear indication when I'm offline, so that I understand my messages will be queued for later delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is disconnected THEN a connection status indicator SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN the user is disconnected THEN the status indicator SHALL show "Disconnected - Messages may not send"
3. WHEN the user is offline THEN the status indicator SHALL remain visible but not block message sending

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want image uploads to be properly handled when offline, so that I understand the limitations of offline functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is offline AND tries to upload an image THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message
2. WHEN the user is offline THEN the image upload button SHALL be disabled
3. WHEN the user is offline THEN existing text messaging functionality SHALL remain unaffected by image upload restrictions
