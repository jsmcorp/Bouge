### Backend architecture and current behavior (from logs + code)

- **Supabase client owner**: `src/lib/supabasePipeline.ts` centralizes client creation, auth/session, message send, outbox processing, and lifecycle hooks. It recreates the client on corruption/timeouts and rebinds listeners.
- **Realtime (chat) layer**: `src/store/chatstore_refactored/*`
  - `realtimeActions.ts`: creates the channel per group, manages reconnects and presence, and relies on the pipeline for auth/token.
  - `stateActions.ts`: wires resume/network events to the pipeline.
  - `offlineActions.ts`: unified outbox trigger/processing orchestration.
  - `fetchActions.ts`, `messageActions*.ts`: message fetch/sync flows.
- **Local storage (SQLite)**: `src/lib/sqliteServices_Refactored/*`
  - `database.ts`: opens encrypted DB, creates schema, applies additive migrations with `ALTER TABLE â€¦ ADD COLUMN â€¦` guarded by `.catch(() => {})`, runs a selfâ€‘test insert/query.
  - Operations files implement CRUD for messages, groups, users, outbox, polls, reactions, etc. `created_at` columns are `INTEGER NOT NULL` (epoch ms).
- **Push**:
  - Client: `src/lib/push.ts` dynamically imports `@capacitor-firebase/messaging` to register an FCM token and upserts into `public.user_devices` via pipeline.
  - Server: `supabase/functions/push-fanout/index.ts` (Edge Function) reads recipients from DB and sends via FCM (v1 preferred, legacy fallback). Also supports draining `public.notification_queue` if invoked without JSON.
  - DB: `supabase/migrations/20250819_user_devices.sql` and `20250819_push_queue.sql` create `user_devices` and `notification_queue`, with a trigger to enqueue on message inserts.

---

### What the logs tell us

1) App startup works
- Supabase pipeline initializes and rehydrates auth.
- SQLite opens encrypted DB, creates tables, and selfâ€‘tests pass. The repeated "duplicate column" ALTER errors are expected because the code intentionally `catch(() => {})` on ALTERs.

2) First load and realtime subscribe also work
- Groups sync to local and UI updates. Realtime subscribes and receives events.

3) Local sync error (NOT NULL)
- During message sync, an insert into `users` fails: `Run: NOT NULL constraint failed: users.created_at`.
  - Evidence: attempt to save user "Bobby" with `created_at = null` triggers the constraint.
  - Impact: This doesnâ€™t crash the app (caught), but it degrades local consistency and may shortâ€‘circuit parts of the sync.

4) Push function call fails due to CORS
- Preflight to `â€¦/functions/v1/push-fanout` from `https://localhost` is blocked. No `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in the Edge Function response.
  - Impact: Even though messages are saved serverâ€‘side, your direct fanâ€‘out call fails. Unless the function is invoked some other way (cron/webhook), no notifications are sent.

5) Push plugin is not initialized
- `Push init skipped (plugin missing or error): Failed to resolve module specifier '@capacitor-firebase/messaging'`.
  - Impact: No device token is registered â†’ no rows in `public.user_devices` â†’ push fanâ€‘out has nobody to notify.

6) After lock/unlock (resume) realtime breaks until restart
- Repeated patterns:
  - `getSession timed out after 2500ms` â†’ pipeline schedules hard recreate â†’ multiple client reâ€‘inits â†’ repeated `SIGNED_IN` events â†’ force reconnects.
  - Realtime switches through `CLOSED/TIMED_OUT` and reconnect attempts, with outbox watchdog timeouts.
  - You often see "Multiple GoTrueClient instances" warnings, a sign of repeated client creation under the same storage key.
  - Practically, sends fall back to outbox and realtime doesnâ€™t consistently deliver until a fresh app start.

---

### Root causes (ranked)

1) Lifecycle duplication + aggressive corruption handling â†’ client thrash on resume
- Both `src/main.tsx` and `src/App.tsx` listen for `appStateChange`/`resume` and each causes a pipeline resume (directly or via `onWake` â†’ `onAppResumeSimplified` â†’ pipeline `onAppResume`).
- The pipelineâ€™s health/corruption probes call `auth.getSession()` under strict timeouts in multiple places (`checkHealth`, `refreshSession`, resume/network handlers, realtime auth watcher). Concurrent timeouts schedule multiple hard recreates. Recreate tears down channels and rebinds auth listeners, which themselves trigger more activity.
- Net result: several interleaved resumes/reconnects, token refreshes, and client recreations cause realtime to flap (CLOSED/TIMED_OUT), and the system falls back to the outbox.

2) Push path is broken (two separate issues)
- Client side: FCM plugin is missing â†’ no tokens stored.
- Server side: Edge function lacks CORS handling for `OPTIONS` and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` â†’ the direct fanâ€‘out call from the app is blocked.
- Also, no clear scheduler to drain `notification_queue` when the direct call fails.

3) Local sync bug: user `created_at` can be null/NaN
- The SQLite schema requires `users.created_at INTEGER NOT NULL`.
- Converters pass `new Date(x).getTime()`, which becomes `NaN` when `x` is missing/invalid; many SQLite bindings coerce `NaN` â†’ `null` â†’ constraint failure.

4) Extra complexity increases the surface for races
- Multiple heartbeat/watchdog/timer layers (pipeline health checks + realtime watchdog + unified outbox watchdog + background preloading + cache), all firing around resume/network changes, amplify timing races.

---

### What to fix first (minimum changes to get stability)

1) Single lifecycle owner (eliminate duplicate resume handlers)
- Keep only one: either `src/main.tsx` or `src/App.tsx`, not both. All resume/network events should flow to a single place that calls the pipeline once.
- Make resume idempotent: ensure only one resume sequence can run at a time (guarded promise) with a 2â€“3s lockout. The pipeline already has `lastResumeAt` debouncing; duplication bypasses this.

2) Stop recreating the client aggressively
- Remove/disable the multiâ€‘probe corruption detection on resume/network and reduce `getSession` timeout thrash. Prefer a single `initialize(false)` and a single bounded `getSession()` check; only hardâ€‘recreate when absolutely necessary (e.g., repeated failures over several seconds).
- Deâ€‘duplicate `getSession` callers: centralize session fetch in the pipeline and let others rely on the inâ€‘memory last known session (already tracked as `lastKnown*`).

3) Fix SQLite user.created_at writes
- When persisting users, coerce `created_at` safely:
  - If source is missing/invalid â†’ use `Date.now()`.
  - Always pass a finite integer to satisfy `NOT NULL`.
- This will remove the recurring local sync error and avoid aborting related sync steps.

4) Make push reliable
- Install and configure `@capacitor-firebase/messaging` so the app actually registers tokens.
- Add CORS handling to the Edge Function (reply to `OPTIONS`; set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` or your allowed origins) so client invocations succeed.
- Alternatively (recommended for simplicity), donâ€™t call the function from the client at all. Rely on the `notification_queue` trigger and set a Supabase Scheduled Function (cron) to invoke `push-fanout` every few seconds to drain the queue. This decouples push from client state and CORS entirely.

---

### Simplify to reduce race surface (suggested refactor plan)

- **Lifecycle**:
  - One handler in `src/main.tsx` for `appStateChange` and `resume`, and one for `networkStatusChange`. Remove the parallel handler in `src/App.tsx`.
  - Route both to a single `pipeline.onAppResume()` call guarded internally against reentry.

- **Pipeline**:
  - Keep a single, longâ€‘lived `createClient`; avoid frequent hard recreates.
  - Reduce `getSession` timeouts and calls. Do not call `getSession` from heartbeat/watchdog paths; use cached session unless an operation actually needs a fresh token.
  - On resume: do at most one bounded `getSession` (or `getUser`) and, if present, set `realtime.setAuth(accessToken)` and reconnect the single channel.

- **Realtime**:
  - Keep the simplified connection (already implemented) but rely on the pipeline to feed a token; remove extra forceâ€‘reconnects on every auth event. Prefer single "forceReconnect" on resume and on explicit token refresh.

- **Outbox**:
  - The unified trigger system is fine; ensure only the active processing run exists (the code does that) and reduce external triggers to: (a) resume, (b) realtime CONNECTED, (c) auth token refreshed, (d) new message enqueued. Avoid scheduling additional triggers from health/heartbeat paths.

- **SQLite**:
  - Keep the current additive migrations; the duplicate column errors are benign due to `.catch(() => {})`.
  - Fix `users.created_at` write path as above.

- **Push** (recommended path):
  - Register tokens via plugin â†’ store in `public.user_devices`.
  - Stop calling `push-fanout` from the app; schedule the function to drain `notification_queue` every 10â€“15s, or trigger serverâ€‘side after insert.

---

### Evidence in code (key spots)

- Pipeline creates client and rebinds listeners on initialize (potentially many times):
```116:151:src/lib/supabasePipeline.ts
public async initialize(force: boolean = false): Promise<void> {
  â€¦
  if (!this.client || force) {
    this.client = createClient<Database>(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
      auth: { persistSession: true, autoRefreshToken: true, detectSessionInUrl: false },
    });
    â€¦ // bindAuthListenersToClient()
  }
}
```

- Resume does corruption probe + possible hard recreation, then triggers outbox:
```1376:1412:src/lib/supabasePipeline.ts
public async onAppResume(): Promise<void> {
  this.log('ðŸ“± App resume detected');
  â€¦
  const corrupted = await this.isClientCorrupted(2500);
  if (corrupted) await this.hardRecreateClient('app-resume-corruption');
  else {
    await this.initialize(false);
    this.ensureSessionFreshness().catch(() => {});
  }
  this.triggerOutboxProcessing('app-resume');
}
```

- Realtime subscription sets token then subscribes; on CLOSED/TIMED_OUT it schedules reconnect and can refresh session again:
```456:505:src/store/chatstore_refactored/realtimeActions.ts
setupSimplifiedRealtimeSubscription: async (groupId: string) => {
  â€¦
  const accessToken = await getAccessTokenBounded(FEATURES_PUSH.auth.refreshTimeoutMs);
  (await supabasePipeline.getDirectClient()).realtime?.setAuth?.(accessToken || undefined);
  â€¦ subscribe( status => { â€¦ if (status === 'CLOSED'|'TIMED_OUT') { scheduleReconnect(groupId) } })
}
```

- Local sync of users uses `created_at` from Supabase rows and can pass invalid timestamps:
```690:709:src/store/chatstore_refactored/fetchActions.ts
await sqliteService.saveUser({
  â€¦
  created_at: new Date(msg.users.created_at).getTime() // â‡’ NaN â†’ coerced to null â†’ NOT NULL failure
});
```

- Edge Function lacks CORS handling for preflight/allowâ€‘origin (only returns plain Responses).
```170:222:supabase/functions/push-fanout/index.ts
serve(async (req) => {
  if (req.method !== 'POST') return new Response('Method not allowed', { status: 405 });
  â€¦ return new Response('ok'); // No CORS headers; no OPTIONS handling
});
```

- App wires resume in more than one place (duplicated lifecycle):
```21:33:src/main.tsx
CapApp.addListener('appStateChange', ({ isActive }) => {
  if (isActive) { useChatStore.getState().onWake?.('resume'); }
});
CapApp.addListener('resume', () => { useChatStore.getState().onWake?.('resume'); });
```
```47:120:src/App.tsx
CapacitorApp.addListener('appStateChange', handleAppStateChange);
â€¦ if (isActive) { setTimeout(() => { onAppResume(); }, 500); }
```

### POTENTIAL REMAINING ROOT CAUSES (If fixes above don't work)

**Areas to investigate further:**

1. **Supabase Client Configuration Issues**
   - `persistSession: true` may conflict with mobile lifecycle
   - `autoRefreshToken: true` timing issues during device unlock
   - Client instance recreation frequency
   - **Evidence**: Pipeline creates client with `persistSession: true, autoRefreshToken: true` but may conflict with mobile WebView lifecycle

2. **Mobile Platform-Specific Issues**
   - Android/iOS background app restrictions affecting WebSocket connections
   - WebView context switching during lock/unlock cycles
   - Capacitor plugin lifecycle management and timing
   - **Evidence**: App uses Capacitor WebView which may lose connection context during device sleep

3. **Session Management Edge Cases**
   - Token expiry during device lock period (tokens expire while device is locked)
   - Refresh token invalidation due to mobile security policies
   - Session storage corruption on mobile platforms
   - **Evidence**: Multiple session caching layers with 15s cache validity may not account for long lock periods

4. **Realtime Connection Architecture**
   - WebSocket connection persistence through device sleep cycles
   - Realtime channel subscription state management across app lifecycle
   - Connection pooling issues with Supabase realtime
   - **Evidence**: Channel cleanup and recreation logic may not properly handle WebSocket state

5. **Timing and Race Conditions**
   - App resume vs network reconnect timing conflicts
   - Multiple concurrent session refresh attempts
   - Realtime subscription setup vs token application timing
   - **Evidence**: Multiple debouncing layers (3s in main.tsx, 5s in pipeline) may still allow race conditions

6. **SQLite Encryption and Storage Issues**
   - Encrypted SQLite database access after device unlock
   - Biometric authentication conflicts with session recovery
   - Preferences storage corruption affecting encryption keys
   - **Evidence**: Uses encrypted SQLite with biometric auth disabled, but encryption key management may fail after device unlock

7. **WebView-Specific Connection Issues**
   - WebView network stack reset during device sleep
   - JavaScript execution context preservation
   - WebSocket connection state not properly restored
   - **Evidence**: Android WebView configuration may not preserve connection state through sleep cycles

8. **Token Refresh Timing Issues**
   - Token refresh attempts during network unavailability
   - Concurrent token refresh operations causing conflicts
   - Token application to realtime client timing
   - **Evidence**: Multiple token refresh mechanisms with different timeouts (5s, 8s) may conflict

---

### DEEP DIVE ANALYSIS - ADDITIONAL ROOT CAUSES DISCOVERED

**Critical Issues Found in Codebase:**

1. **WebView Context Loss During Device Sleep**
   - **Location**: Android WebView configuration in `android/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml`
   - **Issue**: Standard WebView without proper lifecycle preservation
   - **Impact**: WebSocket connections lost when WebView context is destroyed during device sleep
   - **Fix Needed**: Configure WebView to preserve connection state or implement proper reconnection on context restore

2. **SQLite Encryption Key Management**
   - **Location**: `src/lib/sqliteSecret.ts`
   - **Issue**: Encryption key may become inaccessible after device unlock due to Capacitor Preferences timing
   - **Impact**: Session data corruption or inaccessibility after device unlock
   - **Fix Needed**: Implement robust key recovery mechanism with fallback strategies

3. **Multiple Session Caching Layers Conflict**
   - **Location**: `src/lib/supabasePipeline.ts` (lines 109-111, 562-567)
   - **Issue**: 15-second session cache validity insufficient for device lock periods
   - **Impact**: Stale session data used after long lock periods
   - **Fix Needed**: Implement lock-aware session cache invalidation

4. **Realtime Token Application Race Condition**
   - **Location**: `src/store/chatstore_refactored/realtimeActions.ts` (lines 594-597, 812-815)
   - **Issue**: Token applied to realtime client before connection is fully established
   - **Impact**: Auth failures on realtime subscription after device unlock
   - **Fix Needed**: Ensure token application happens after connection establishment

5. **Capacitor Plugin Lifecycle Mismatch**
   - **Location**: `src/main.tsx` and `src/App.tsx` app state handlers
   - **Issue**: App state change events may not align with actual WebView lifecycle
   - **Impact**: Resume handlers triggered before WebView context is fully restored
   - **Fix Needed**: Add WebView readiness checks before attempting reconnection

6. **Network Status vs Connection State Desync**
   - **Location**: `src/main.tsx` (lines 80-101)
   - **Issue**: Network status changes don't account for WebView-specific connectivity
   - **Impact**: Premature reconnection attempts while WebView is still initializing
   - **Fix Needed**: Implement WebView-aware network status checking

**Recommended Next Steps (If Current Fixes Don't Work):**

1. **Implement WebView Lifecycle Awareness**
   - Add WebView readiness detection before reconnection attempts
   - Configure Android WebView to preserve connection state
   - Implement proper WebView context restoration handling

2. **Enhanced Session Management**
   - Extend session cache validity for mobile platforms
   - Implement device lock detection and session preservation
   - Add session corruption detection and recovery

3. **Realtime Connection State Machine**
   - Implement proper connection state management
   - Add connection readiness checks before token application
   - Implement connection health monitoring with WebView awareness

4. **Mobile-Specific Configuration**
   - Configure Capacitor plugins for better lifecycle management
   - Implement platform-specific reconnection strategies
   - Add mobile-specific debugging and monitoring

### Original Concrete fix plan (ordered)

1) Lifecycle and resumability
- âœ… Remove duplicate `appStateChange`/`resume` listeners so only one path calls `pipeline.onAppResume()`.
- âœ… Inside the pipeline, guard `onAppResume()` with a single inâ€‘flight promise; skip if it ran within the last ~2â€“3s.
- âœ… Do not run `detectCorruption()` on every resume; keep a cheap check (single `getSession` call with a relaxed timeout, or skip entirely and rely on reconnection when needed).

2) Reduce session calls and recreations
- Ensure only one `getSession` call can be active; cache result for a short window and reuse across listeners.
- Recreate the client only upon clear, persistent failure (e.g., several consecutive subscribe failures or a token operation that errors, not just a timeout once).

3) SQLite safety
- When saving users: `const ts = Number.isFinite(new Date(src).getTime()) ? new Date(src).getTime() : Date.now();`
- Consider relaxing the column to `INTEGER` (nullable) if you donâ€™t strictly require nonâ€‘null in local cache.

4) Push reliability
- Install and configure `@capacitor-firebase/messaging`; verify `FirebaseMessaging.getToken()` works on device. Ensure `google-services.json` is present (it is) and Gradle is wired.
- Add CORS headers and `OPTIONS` preflight handling to `push-fanout`, or avoid CORS entirely by using a Scheduled Function to drain `notification_queue`.
- Prefer the serverâ€‘driven push path for consistency even when the app is backgrounded or killed.

5) Optional simplifications to lower complexity
- Stick to one cache strategy (keep `messageCache`, but drop multiâ€‘layer preload/heartbeat timers).
- Keep unified outbox (itâ€™s useful), but restrict triggers to the four key events and remove secondary health triggers.
- Reduce logging volume in production; keep debug tags behind a feature flag.

---

### How this addresses your three issues

1) "Lock/unlock â†’ no realtime; must restart"
- A single resumability path + fewer recreations/session calls prevents the thrash that leaves Realtime in CLOSED/TIMED_OUT.
- Token is applied once via `realtime.setAuth()` and a single `forceReconnect()` is issued.

2) "First open works well"
- This will remain unchanged; the simplification targets only resume/network transitions.

3) "No notifications when app closed/background"
- With the plugin installed, tokens are stored.
- With CORS fixed or (better) a scheduled serverâ€‘side drain, pushes are sent regardless of client state, so background delivery works.

---

### Validation checklist after changes

- Resume the app 10Ã— in a row; ensure:
  - At most one `onAppResume` run per resume.
  - Realtime channel reaches SUBSCRIBED within ~3â€“5s; no loops of CLOSED/TIMED_OUT.
  - No repeated `Multiple GoTrueClient instances` warnings.
- Send message while network toggles offlineâ†’online; confirm outbox delivers and UI refreshes within a second after reconnect.
- Verify `users.created_at` never fails by inspecting recent logs.
- Receive a push while the app is backgrounded and when it is killed.

---

### Quick wins (can be done independently)

- Add CORS to `push-fanout` and an `OPTIONS` handler.
- Install the FCM plugin and confirm token registration flow (look for `[push] token:registered`).
- Fix `users.created_at` write path.
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Remove one of the two resume listeners.

These four alone will remove the biggest current blockers (push + resume thrash + SQLite sync error). After that, you can further trim corruption/health logic to simplify the codebase.

---

## âœ… IMPLEMENTED FIXES (2025-09-15)

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Resume Handlers
**Problem**: Both `main.tsx` and `App.tsx` were listening for `appStateChange` events, causing duplicate calls to `supabasePipeline.onAppResume()`.

**Solution**:
- Removed the duplicate `onAppResume()` call from `App.tsx`
- Kept only the centralized handler in `main.tsx` that calls `useChatStore.getState().onWake?.('resume')`
- Added comments explaining the centralized approach
- Dashboard-specific preloading logic remains in `App.tsx` but without triggering resume

**Files Modified**: `src/App.tsx`

### 2. Implemented Session Verification Deduplication
**Problem**: Multiple concurrent `getSession()` calls were causing timeouts and client recreation loops.

**Solution**:
- Added session caching with 5-second validity window
- Implemented in-flight promise deduplication to prevent concurrent `getSession()` calls
- Added `invalidateSessionCache()` method called after session refresh and client recreation
- Created centralized `fetchSessionInternal()` method for actual Supabase calls

**Files Modified**: `src/lib/supabasePipeline.ts`

### 3. Reduced Aggressive Corruption Detection
**Problem**: Complex multi-check corruption detector was causing more problems than it solved, with 5 different checks including multiple `getSession()` calls.

**Solution**:
- Simplified `detectCorruption()` to use only the simple timeout-based `isClientCorrupted()` check
- Increased corruption check frequency from every 3 seconds to every 10 seconds in `getClient()`
- Reduced timeout for corruption checks from 2500ms to 1500ms for faster detection
- Removed complex multi-probe system (authCheck, dbCheck, realtimeCheck, promiseCheck, rpcCheck)

**Files Modified**: `src/lib/supabasePipeline.ts`

### 4. Enhanced onAppResume Reentry Protection
**Problem**: Existing debouncing wasn't sufficient to prevent overlapping resume sequences.

**Solution**:
- Added proper reentry protection using `inFlightResumePromise`
- Split `onAppResume()` into public method and private `performAppResume()` implementation
- Enhanced corruption check logic to skip if checked recently (within 5 seconds)
- Maintained existing 1500ms debouncing while adding promise-based protection

**Files Modified**: `src/lib/supabasePipeline.ts`

### 5. Centralized Session Management
**Problem**: Multiple parts of codebase were calling `client.auth.getSession()` directly, bypassing deduplication.

**Solution**:
- Replaced direct `client.auth.getSession()` calls with `supabasePipeline.getSession()` in:
  - `src/store/chatstore_refactored/realtimeActions.ts` (3 locations)
  - `src/store/chatstore_refactored/utils.ts` (1 location)
  - Internal pipeline methods (`ensureSessionFreshness`, `hardRecreateClient`)
- All session access now goes through the centralized, deduplicated pipeline method

**Files Modified**:
- `src/store/chatstore_refactored/realtimeActions.ts`
- `src/store/chatstore_refactored/utils.ts`
- `src/lib/supabasePipeline.ts`

### Expected Impact
These changes should significantly reduce:
1. **Resume thrashing**: Single resume handler prevents duplicate pipeline calls
2. **Session timeout loops**: Deduplication prevents concurrent `getSession()` calls
3. **Corruption false positives**: Simplified detection reduces unnecessary client recreations
4. **Reentry issues**: Proper promise-based protection prevents overlapping operations

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Resume the app 10Ã— in a row; ensure at most one `onAppResume` run per resume
- [ ] Verify realtime channel reaches SUBSCRIBED within ~3â€“5s; no loops of CLOSED/TIMED_OUT
- [ ] Confirm no repeated `Multiple GoTrueClient instances` warnings
- [ ] Test message sending while network toggles offlineâ†’online
- [ ] Monitor logs for reduced `getSession timeout` errors

## âœ… COMPREHENSIVE LOCK/UNLOCK FIX (2025-09-16)

### Problem Analysis
From the logs, the core issues after device lock/unlock were:
1. **Session timeout loops**: `getSession timed out after 2500ms` causing corruption detection
2. **Multiple client recreations**: "Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected" warnings
3. **Realtime connection failures**: Channels stuck in CLOSED/TIMED_OUT states
4. **SQLite constraint failures**: `NOT NULL constraint failed: users.created_at` from invalid timestamps
5. **Message sending failures**: Falls back to outbox but realtime doesn't recover

### Comprehensive Solution Implemented

#### 1. Simplified Corruption Detection
**Problem**: Complex multi-probe corruption detector was causing more problems than it solved.

**Solution**:
- Replaced complex `detectCorruption()` with simple client existence check
- Removed timeout-based `getSession()` calls from corruption detection
- Reduced corruption check frequency and made it less aggressive

**Files Modified**: `src/lib/supabasePipeline.ts`

#### 2. Enhanced Global Operation Lock
**Problem**: Multiple concurrent operations (resume, network reconnect, corruption checks) were interfering.

**Solution**:
- Added `globalOperationLock` to prevent concurrent operations
- Both `onAppResume()` and `onNetworkReconnect()` now use this lock
- Increased debounce time from 1.5s to 2s for resume events

**Files Modified**: `src/lib/supabasePipeline.ts`

#### 3. Robust Session Management with Fallbacks
**Problem**: Session timeouts were causing cascading failures.

**Solution**:
- Added timeout protection to `fetchSessionInternal()` (3s timeout)
- Created `getWorkingSession()` method with multiple fallback strategies:
  1. Fresh session from Supabase
  2. Cached session if fresh fetch fails
  3. Last known tokens as final fallback
- Increased session cache validity from 5s to 10s
- Updated all session access points to use the new robust method

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/supabasePipeline.ts`
- `src/store/chatstore_refactored/realtimeActions.ts`

#### 4. Simplified Resume Flow
**Problem**: Complex resume logic with corruption checks was causing client thrashing.

**Solution**:
- Removed aggressive corruption detection from resume flow
- Simplified to: initialize client â†’ invalidate session cache â†’ apply fresh token â†’ trigger reconnect
- Added proper error handling with hard recreate as last resort
- Reduced timeout for realtime reconnection trigger

**Files Modified**: `src/lib/supabasePipeline.ts`

#### 5. Fixed SQLite Timestamp Constraint Violations
**Problem**: `new Date(invalid_value).getTime()` returns `NaN`, which becomes `null` in SQLite, violating NOT NULL constraints.

**Solution**:
- Created `SupabasePipeline.safeTimestamp()` utility function
- Updated all user save operations to use safe timestamp conversion
- Fallback to `Date.now()` for invalid timestamps

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/supabasePipeline.ts` (added utility function)
- `src/store/chatstore_refactored/fetchActions.ts`
- `src/store/chatstore_refactored/messageActions_fixed.ts`
- `src/store/chatstore_refactored/offlineActions.ts`
- `src/store/chatstore_refactored/groupActions.ts`

#### 6. Improved Hard Recreation Logic
**Problem**: Multiple concurrent recreations and insufficient cleanup.

**Solution**:
- Added proper deduplication for concurrent recreation requests
- Added settling time (100ms) after client teardown
- Improved error handling and logging
- Increased realtime reconnection delay to 300ms

**Files Modified**: `src/lib/supabasePipeline.ts`

### Expected Impact
These changes should eliminate:
1. **Session timeout loops**: Robust session management with fallbacks
2. **Client recreation thrashing**: Global operation lock prevents conflicts
3. **Realtime connection issues**: Simplified flow with proper token application
4. **SQLite constraint errors**: Safe timestamp conversion
5. **Message sending failures**: More reliable realtime connection recovery

### Key Behavioral Changes
- **Resume events**: Now use global lock, simplified flow, no aggressive corruption detection
- **Session access**: All goes through robust `getWorkingSession()` with fallbacks
- **Timestamp handling**: All user saves use safe conversion with fallback to current time
- **Client recreation**: Properly deduplicated with settling time
- **Error recovery**: More graceful fallbacks instead of aggressive recreation

### Testing Recommendations
1. **Lock/Unlock Test**: Lock device, wait 30s, unlock, verify realtime reconnects within 5s
2. **Network Toggle**: Turn off WiFi, wait 10s, turn on, verify message sending works
3. **Rapid Resume**: Lock/unlock rapidly 10 times, verify no "Multiple GoTrueClient" warnings
4. **Message Sending**: Send messages immediately after unlock, verify they go through realtime not outbox
5. **SQLite Integrity**: Check logs for absence of "NOT NULL constraint failed" errors
