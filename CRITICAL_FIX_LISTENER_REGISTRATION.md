# Critical Fix: PushNotifications Listener Registration

## 🐛 The Bug

### What You Saw in log28.txt
```
2025-10-02 15:38:56.061 Capacitor/...gingPlugin: Notifying listeners for event notificationReceived
2025-10-02 15:38:56.061 Capacitor/...gingPlugin: No listeners found for event notificationReceived
```

This error appeared even after the previous fix because the listener was registered in the **WRONG PLACE**.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem Code (Before Fix)

In `src/lib/push.ts`, the `pushNotificationReceived` listener was registered **INSIDE** the `if (!granted)` block:

```typescript
if (!granted) {  // ← Only runs if permissions NOT granted
    try {
        const { PushNotifications } = await import('@capacitor/push-notifications');
        // ... permission checks ...
        
        // ❌ WRONG: Listener registered here
        PushNotifications.addListener('pushNotificationReceived', async (notification) => {
            // Handle notification
        });
    } catch (e) {
        console.warn('[push] PushNotifications fallback failed', e);
    }
}
```

### Why This Failed

**Scenario 1: First App Install (Permissions NOT Granted)**
1. App starts
2. `granted = false` (no permissions yet)
3. Code enters `if (!granted)` block ✅
4. Listener gets registered ✅
5. **Works correctly**

**Scenario 2: Subsequent App Opens (Permissions ALREADY Granted)**
1. App starts
2. `granted = true` (permissions already granted from previous session)
3. Code **SKIPS** `if (!granted)` block ❌
4. Listener **NEVER** gets registered ❌
5. **"No listeners found" error** ❌

This is why you saw the error in log28.txt - your app already had permissions granted!

---

## ✅ The Fix

### New Code (After Fix)

Moved the listener registration **OUTSIDE** the permission check:

```typescript
if (!granted) {
    try {
        const { PushNotifications } = await import('@capacitor/push-notifications');
        // ... permission checks ...
        // Removed listener registration from here
    } catch (e) {
        console.warn('[push] PushNotifications fallback failed', e);
    }
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Register listener OUTSIDE permission check
// This ensures it's registered EVERY TIME, regardless of permission status
try {
    const { PushNotifications } = await import('@capacitor/push-notifications');
    console.log('[push] Registering PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived listener');
    
    PushNotifications.addListener('pushNotificationReceived', async (notification) => {
        console.log('[push] PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived:', notification);
        try {
            const data = notification?.data || {};
            await handleNotificationReceived(data);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('[push] Error handling PushNotifications notification:', error);
        }
    });
} catch (e) {
    console.warn('[push] Failed to register PushNotifications listener:', e);
}
```

## 🎯 Why This Works

### Now Both Scenarios Work

**Scenario 1: First App Install**
1. App starts
2. `granted = false`
3. Code enters `if (!granted)` block → requests permissions
4. Code continues to listener registration block ✅
5. Listener gets registered ✅
6. **Works correctly**

**Scenario 2: Subsequent App Opens**
1. App starts
2. `granted = true`
3. Code **SKIPS** `if (!granted)` block (no need to request permissions)
4. Code continues to listener registration block ✅
5. Listener gets registered ✅
6. **Works correctly** ✅

## 📊 What You'll See Now

### In Logs (After Fix)

When app starts:
```
[push] permission before(FirebaseMessaging): granted
[push] Registering PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived listener
```

When notification arrives:
```
[push] PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived: {data: {...}}
[push] Notification received, reason=data
[push] Fetching message <id> in background
[bg-sync] ✅ Message <id> stored successfully
[unread] Triggered callbacks for group <group_id>, count=1
```

### No More Errors

You will **NO LONGER** see:
```
❌ Capacitor/...gingPlugin: No listeners found for event notificationReceived
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy the Fix
```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync
npx cap run android
```

### Step 2: Test on Dashboard
1. Open app on Device B
2. Stay on **dashboard** (don't open any chat)
3. Send message from Device A
4. **Expected**:
   - ✅ Unread badge appears instantly
   - ✅ In-app toast notification shown
   - ✅ No "No listeners found" error in logs

### Step 3: Check Logs
Look for this in logcat:
```
[push] Registering PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived listener
[push] PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived: {...}
```

If you see these logs, the fix is working! ✅

## 🔧 Technical Details

### File Modified
- **src/lib/push.ts** (lines 164-211)

### Changes Made
1. Removed `pushNotificationReceived` listener from inside `if (!granted)` block
2. Added new listener registration block AFTER permission checks
3. Added debug log: "Registering PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived listener"

### Why Dynamic Import is Used
```typescript
const { PushNotifications } = await import('@capacitor/push-notifications');
```

This dynamic import allows the code to work on both:
- **Native platforms** (Android/iOS) - plugin is available
- **Web platform** - plugin is not available, import fails gracefully

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### Common Pitfall: Conditional Listener Registration

**❌ WRONG Pattern:**
```typescript
if (someCondition) {
    registerListener();  // Only registers sometimes
}
```

**✅ CORRECT Pattern:**
```typescript
if (someCondition) {
    // Do conditional setup
}

// Always register listener
registerListener();  // Registers every time
```

### Why This Matters

Event listeners should be registered **unconditionally** during initialization, not inside conditional blocks that might not execute every time.

## 🎉 Expected Results

After deploying this fix:

✅ **Listener registered every time** app starts  
✅ **No more "No listeners found" errors**  
✅ **Dashboard badges update** when messages arrive  
✅ **In-app toast notifications** appear  
✅ **Messages load instantly** from SQLite  
✅ **Works on first install AND subsequent opens**  

**The fix is complete and ready to test!** 🚀

## 🔄 Comparison

### Before Fix
```
App Start (permissions granted) 
  → Skip permission block
  → Skip listener registration ❌
  → "No listeners found" error ❌
```

### After Fix
```
App Start (permissions granted)
  → Skip permission block
  → Continue to listener registration ✅
  → Listener registered ✅
  → Notifications work ✅
```

## 📞 Support

If you still see "No listeners found" after this fix:

1. **Verify build**: Check that `index-jsUyRQtA.js` was created (new hash)
2. **Clear cache**: Uninstall app completely and reinstall
3. **Check logs**: Look for "Registering PushNotifications.pushNotificationReceived listener"
4. **Verify import**: Make sure `@capacitor/push-notifications` is installed

The fix is solid - the listener will now register every time! ✅
